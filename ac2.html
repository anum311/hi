<p>Cats, also known as domestic cats (Felis catus), are small, carnivorous mammals that have been domesticated for nearly 10,000 years1. They are popular pets worldwide. Cats are mostly nocturnal, with excellent vision and hearing. Their ability to navigate difficult environments and land on all fours contributes to their reputation for having nine lives</p>
